# AI-Powered Health Checkups

## Project Overview
AI-Powered Health Checkups is a project aimed at integrating artificial intelligence into healthcare for personalized health risk assessments and treatment recommendations. By analyzing full-body check-up reports, the system can detect potential health risks, determine their severity, and provide actionable treatment suggestions tailored to individual patients.

## Objectives
1. Extract relevant data from medical check-up reports for accurate health assessment.
2. Diagnose multiple health problems and rank their severity (mild, moderate, or severe).
3. Generate precise and actionable treatment suggestions tailored to individual health profiles.
4. Ensure that treatment recommendations are easy to understand and dynamically responsive to changes in patient health.
5. Develop an iterative system that updates recommendations based on patient progress.

## Methodology
1. **Data Processing:** Extract medical data from reports (e.g., blood tests, summary notes) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and preprocess it with tokenization.
2. **Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs):** Utilize pre-trained models like BioGPT or PubMedBERT to understand medical terminology and improve assessment accuracy.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** Use logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks to predict health risks based on historical and current medical data.

## Data Sources
- Medical reports from hospitals, including full-body check-ups, clinical summaries, and research papers.
- Reports in PDF format, processed using OCR for data extraction.

## System Architecture
The AI system consists of:
- **Data Extraction Layer:** OCR and NLP-based processing of medical reports.
- **AI Model Layer:** LLMs for medical understanding and ML models for risk assessment.
- **Recommendation Engine:** Personalized treatment suggestions based on the extracted insights.

## Expected Outcomes
- Improved early detection of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid issues.
- Personalized health recommendations, including medication, dietary advice, and exercise plans.
- A dynamic and iterative system that adapts recommendations based on patient progress.
